HDB Resale Price Predictor üè°
By Jaeden, Denzil, Wanying, Jim and Jeremiah
Introduction
This project is a collaborative effort of five teammates, Jaeden, Denzil, Wanying, Jim, Jeremiah, during our General Assembly Data Analyst Immersive Bootcamp 4-day data sprint in September 2024!

Modelling
We chose XGBoost as our model of choice because out of the 3 models, XGBoost's train and test RMSE values differed the least indicating a reliable model. Its run time is also approximately 1/4 of the other 2 models' run time.

Streamlit Demo
Demo over here: HDB sales predictor

The predictor uses the input variables to determine the HDB resale pricing. Our agents at WOW! can input these different variables to predict pricing.
