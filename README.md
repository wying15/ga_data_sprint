# **HDB Resale Price Predictor** üè° 

By Wanying, Jaeden, Denzil, Jim, and Jeremiah

## **Introduction**

This project is a collaborative effort of five teammates - Wanying, Jaeden, Denzil, Jim, Jeremiah - during a 4-day data sprint as part of the General Assembly Data Analyst Bootcamp! üíª

## **Modelling**

We chose XGBoost as our model of choice because out of the 3 models, XGBoost's train and test RMSE values differed the least indicating a reliable model. Its run time is also approximately 1/4 of the other 2 models' run time. 

## **Demo**

Demo on Streamlit: [HDB sales predictor](https://datasprint-wy.streamlit.app/)

The predictor uses the input variables to determine the HDB resale pricing. 
Input variables were optimised from 80 to 20 variables through combination of exploratory data analysis (EDA) and modelling/backward elimination.
Our agents at WOW! can input these different variables to predict pricing.
